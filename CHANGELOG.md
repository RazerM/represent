# Change Log

## [Unreleased][unreleased]
N/A

## [1.4.0] - 2015-09-02
### Added
- `BaseReprHelper`, base class for `ReprHelper` and `PrettyReprHelper` to handle common functionality and enforce same API and docstrings.
- `BaseReprHelper.parantheses` tuple can be set to something other than normal brackets, e.g. `('<', '>')`

### Fixed
- `BaseReprHelper.keyword_from_attr` parameter names swapped. `attr_name` used to refer to keyword name, which doesn't make sense.

## [1.3.0] - 2015-05-07
### Added
- `ReprHelperMixin` to simplify [manual generation](http://pythonhosted.org/Represent/usage/helper/)

### Fixed
- `PrettyReprHelper.positional_from_attr()` didn't check for cycle, causing recursion limit to be reached for self-referential objects.

## [1.2.1] - 2015-05-02
### Fixed
- `__init__.py` was missing from represent.compat, so wasn't packaged for PyPI.

## [1.2.0] - 2015-05-02
### Changed
- `RepresentationMixin` has been renamed to `ReprMixin`.
- `RepresentationHelper` has been renamed to `ReprHelper`.
- `PrettyRepresentationHelper` has been renamed to `PrettyReprHelper`.

### Added
- `ReprMixinBase` is available if user does not want to inherit `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` from `ReprMixin`.
- Documentation about Pickle support for ReprMixin (#2)

### Deprecated
These aliases will raise deprecation warnings:

- `RepresentationMixin`
- `RepresentationHelper`
- `PrettyRepresentationHelper`

## [1.1.0] - 2015-04-16
### Added
- Add pickle support by instantiating `RepresentationMixin` in `__setstate__`.

## [1.0.2] - 2015-04-06
### Fixed
- Improve control flow for class variable check, which could previously cause a bug if assertions were disabled.

## [1.0.1] - 2015-04-05
### Fixed
- Remove extra print statement (#1)

## [1.0] - 2015-03-28
